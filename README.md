# cpd_rdpg: Change-Point Detection on Random-Dot Product Graphs (RDPG)

In this repository we share (and keep) implementations of some algorithms regarding the problem of Change-Point Detection (CPD) on graphs. We are particularly interested in the very versatile RDPG model for random graphs (see for instance, [this very complete survey](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3122009.3242083)). As of this moment, we have two algorithms: 
- The offline CPD algorithm described in ``Change point localization in dependent dynamic nonparametric random dot product graphs'' by Oscar Hernan Madrid Padilla, Yi Yu, Carey E. Priebe (preprint available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07494). 
- The online CPD algorithm described in ``Online Change Point Detection for Random Dot Product Graphs'' by Bernardo Marenco, Paola Bermolen, Marcelo Fiori, Federico Larroca and Gonzalo Mateos. Available soon. 

It depends on libraries typically available on most modern Python distributions (in particular NetworkX), with the exception of Graspologic. Visit https://graspologic.readthedocs.io/. 

We have included the main modules and some simple examples we've used to generate some of the graphs of the associated papers.
